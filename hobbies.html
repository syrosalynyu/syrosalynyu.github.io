        <h4>
          🛫 Travel
        </h4>
        <p>
          I love to travel around during my free time because it helps open my mind. I learned their culture by meeting local people and enjoying local foods (definitely my favorite part of traveling)!!

          🏀 Basketball
        </h4>
        <p>
          Basketball has always been my favorite sport. I play basketball since middle school and was the Captain of my team when I was in college.

          🧸 Vinylmations
        </h4>
        <p>Vinylmations are vinyl collectible toys released by Disney. I am fascinated by their detailed designs and also their shapes of Micky Mouse. Although Disney stopped producing Vinylmations from 2017, it doesn't dampen my enthusiasm for collecting these great art pieces created by talented artists. You can see a list of my Vinylmation collections by visiting my <a href="http://chasingvinylmation.com/list/101036830998826730000/own/condensed/">Chasing Vinylmation</a> account.
